## ðŸ“… Day 9 â€“ Closures, passing functions into functions
**Date:** August 12, 2025  
**Focus:** Understanding Closures and its syntax

---

### ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Definitely the hardest day of my learning so far. I have barely grasped my understanding of functions and how to creatively use them and closures has added another level of complexity.

---

Because of how complex the topic is, I was barley able to follow along with my own code so I did not capture much. Saying that though, I will continue to push on.

### ðŸ’» Code Example


```swift
import Cocoa

//How to create and use closures

let sayHello = { (name: String) -> }



//How to use trailing closures and shorthand syntax
let team = ["Gloria", "Suzzane", "Piper", "Tiffany", "Tasha"]


let sorted = team.sorted { String, <#String#> in
    <#code#>
}

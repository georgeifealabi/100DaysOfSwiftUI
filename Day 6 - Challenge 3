## 📅 Day 6 – Challenge 3

### 💻 Challenge
The problem is called fizz buzz, and has been used in job interviews, university entrance tests, and more for as long as I can remember. Your goal is to loop from 1 through 100, and for each number:

If it’s a multiple of 3, print “Fizz”
If it’s a multiple of 5, print “Buzz”
If it’s a multiple of 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”
Otherwise, just print the number.
So, here are some example values you should have when your code runs:

1 should print “1”
2 should print “2”
3 should print “Fizz”
4 should print “4”
5 should print “Buzz”
6 should print “Fizz”
7 should print “7”
…
15 should print “FizzBuzz”
…
100 should print “Buzz”



```swift
//=================================================
//My original attempt below: INCORRECT CODE

for i in 1...100 {
    if i.isMultiple(of: 3) && i.isMultiple(of: 5) {
        print("FizzBuzz")
    }
    if i.isMultiple(of: 3) {
        print("Fizz")
    }
    if i.isMultiple(of: 5) {
        print("Buzz")
    } else {
        print(i)
    }
}


//Correct code provided with the help of ChatGPT

for number in 1...100 {
    if number.isMultiple(of: 3) && number.isMultiple(of: 5) {
        print("FizzBuzz")
    } else if number.isMultiple(of: 3) {
        print("Fizz")
    } else if number.isMultiple(of: 5) {
        print("Buzz")
    } else {
        print(number)
    }
}

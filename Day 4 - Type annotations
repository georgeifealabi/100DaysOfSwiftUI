var score2: Double = 0

var soda: [String] = ["Coke", "Fanta", "Pepsi"]
var teams: [String] = [String]()
var cities: [String] = []
var clues = [String]()



enum UIStyle {
    case light, dark, system
}

var style = UIStyle.light
style = .dark



//This is a comment


//Example of a situration where I might not know or have the value/data of my constant or variable yet, I can still set a type against it.
let username: String
// lots of complex logic
username = "@twostraws"
// lots more complex logic
print(username)
